  	Tandem skydives are a fantastic introduction to the world of freefall. Tandem skydives consist of you, the student, being strapped directly to your instructor, the tandem master. Your instructor will take care of deploying and flying the parachute - you just get to enjoy the amazing experience! Your tandem skydive will include 30 minutes of instruction, a ride to 10,000 feet, 30 seconds of freefall, and a 5-6 minutes canopy ride.
